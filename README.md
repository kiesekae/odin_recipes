This is my fist project that should showcase what I was taught in The Odin Project using HTML5 and including using Git and Github.

Reflection:
In this project I demonstrated all the things that I learned in the HTML portion of The Odin Project. Some things include:
    My boiler plate from mostly memory
    Use of <h1> and other sizes
    Linking other pages of the project on the main index.html page
    Embedding images into each relevant page as well as resizing them and adding alt text
    Creating ordered and unordered lists

Overall I enojoied the project and feel much more comfortable writing html than when I started in the lesssons.
